1. Algorithm for learn service

learning view


Big things:
- admins mÃ¼ssen decks sperren kÃ¶nnen
- gesperrte decks in database (who suspended with Annotations)
--> always check if deck is not suspended
--> refactor all the searching / getting for decks


For public decks:
- if user wants to learn it he gets add to the user Set
    - then gets his personal DeckAlgorithmData but cant edit the public deck
    - only creator of the public deck can make changes

- TODO: save creator of the deck

- TODO: send email if deck gets suspended --> LUCA

- TODO: attribute of the userDeckData if user wants to learn inverted

- TODO: TESTS

- liza's todos --> Lukas
